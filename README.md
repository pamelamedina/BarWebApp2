This uses the same database as the BarConsoleApp in my repository.  This App uses Razor pages. 
I've done a lot of MVC and I wanted to do an app with Razor pages exclusively.
The app displays recipes.  It could be drink recipes or food or anything really.
The app allows the user to add a new recipe or delete a recipe.  Currently it does not update recipes but I wanted to get it posted.
Later I may add the update functionality however right now I think I need to do other things so I am posting it the way that it is.
